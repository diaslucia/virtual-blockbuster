# Virtual Blockbuster 📽️

This website simulates an online shop to buy movies or series.

I came up with the idea after noticing the inconvinience of suscribing to soo many different streaming services, in order to watch your favorite movie/serie.

Why not letting yourself get inspired by the simplicity of the past and create a place where you can find anything you want to watch? That's how "Blockbuster Virtual, just like the good old times" was born.

    "plugins": ["@emotion"]
}
```

> 
> It shows the element ***CartWidget*** as children.
> 
> The function ***GetDocs()*** opens the collection in the firebase dabase called "categories" and saves each of them in the state of ***setCategories()***. Those categories are mapped inside the return() to use them as buttons.

>
> If the ***cart*** lenght is 0, it will show a message to go back shopping. If not, it will show all the products you are buying with the total price.

> ### src/components/Checkout.js
>
> Once we fill the form with our personal information and press "Confirm Order", the ***confirmOrder()*** function is ejecuted.
